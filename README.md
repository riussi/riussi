### Hi there 👋

- I've been working in software professionally for 20+ years
- I wrote my first program in 1986 (Commodore 64 Basic)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on opening up the digital assets world to all players
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Rust (and modern >= C++17) 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on bringing real-world assets to the digital world via tokenisation.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with hiring more Golang/microservices/Docker/K8S engineers. Only direct hires though, no room for agency fees.
- 💬 Ask me about blockchains, DLT, microservices, observability, scaling teams
- 📫 How to reach me: @Riussi on Twitter or on LinkedIn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have planted more than 2.5 million trees in my time (when I was working thru school in the forest industry)
