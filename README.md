### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on opening up the digital assets world to all players
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Rust (and modern >= C++17) 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bringing real-world assets to the digital world via tokenisation.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with hiring more Golang/microservices/Docker/K8S engineers. Only direct hires though, no room for agency fees.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about blockchains, DLT, microservices, observability, scaling teams
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @Riussi on Twitter or on LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have planted more than 2.5 million trees in my time (when I was working thru school in the forest industry)
