### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I've been working in software professionally for 20+ years
- I wrote my first program in 1986 (Commodore 64 Basic)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building the next generation Investment API Platform at Upvest
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Rust (and modern >= C++17) 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m hiring more Golang/microservices/Docker/Kafka/K8S engineers. Only direct hires though, no room for agency fees.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about blockchains, DLT, microservices, observability, scaling teams
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@Riussi on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@riussi) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juharistolainen/)
- I am an early stage startup advisor and a NED (Non-Executive Director) as well as a board member. I also do early stage Angel investing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have planted more than 2.5 million trees in my time (when I was working thru school in the forest industry)

Most of my hobby stuff is private under my Gitlab-account, not here.
